* This is used for mobile support:
```html
<meta name = "viewport" content = "width = device-width, initial-scale = 1">
``` 
* To actually use Foundation, you need to link add this to your HTML:
```html
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/foundation-sites@6.7.5/dist/css/foundation.min.css" crossorigin="anonymous">
 ```
* Another way to use Foundation is to download the files from their website and link them in your HTML. The css comes with three files: app.css, foundation.css, foundation.min.css. foundation.min.css is a lighter version of foundation.css and app.css is used for custom css.

Plan:
- Copy numbercruncher code to this file.
- Create an instance of flask with app = Flask(__name__)
- Under app.route('/'), make a function that calls the occupation_selector() function
and returns the result
- Print all the occupations by creating a variable that gets occupations added to it by a for loop looping
through the keys in the dictionary with all occupations
- Add the variable with all the occupations with the random occupation generator result and add
line breaks to make it neater.

DISCO: 
- random.choices has a weighted parameter to it that randomly picks with probability
- The rsplit() python method could've done what our specialSplit(string) method did.
...
QCC:
- Are there any other way to efficiently turn a csv file into a dictionary?
...
HOW THIS SCRIPT WORKS:
- The file "occupations.csv" is read and put into a list.
- A for loop loops through this list to split the occupations up by commas and stores a list of lists into parsed_text.
- A for loop loops through parsed_text and makes the occupations into keys and percentages into values to the 
dictionary occupations.
- The function occupation_selector takes occupations and randomly selects an occupation with the percentages indicating the
probability of it being selected.

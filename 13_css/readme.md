### QCC
* Lorem Ipsum Generator: https://loremipsum.io/
* We had the line ```<link rel="stylesheet" type="css" href="mimic.css">``` within the head tags of our HTML file. The webpage wasn't displaying any styling. When we removed ```type="css"``` and our line was just ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="mimic.css">```, our webpage was being styled. Why did ```type=css``` prevent this? It was included in the example code on slide 5 of css.pdf. --> ANSWERED ON PIAZZA
